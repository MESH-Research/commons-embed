# Fedora Embed

Fedora Embed is a WordPress single-block plugin for embedding items stored in
[Fedora](https://duraspace.org/fedora/) repositories in WordPress posts and
pages.

It is written primarly for the [Humanities Commons
CORE](https://hcommons.org/core/) repository, though it is designed to work
with any Fedora repository through its [REST
API](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/FEDORA38/REST+API).

This software is in active development.

## Requirements

 * PHP 7.0+
